                <p>Memo and BlockPress are two very popular on-chain social networks. They use a clever OP_RETURN prefixed protocol to write your actions to the blockchain. Later clients can read that data from the chain and recreate your account’s actions. This represents a truly decentralized and censorship resistant social network and it’s only possible on Bitcoin Cash.</p>

                <p>Sending transactions is at the heart of BCH. BITBOX has been able to send transactions for a while but w/ BITBOX Cloud and REST taking shape we wanted to revisit the steps for sending transactions to show how to best leverage the new functionality.</p>

                <p>Bitcoin Cash is all about sending and receiving payments. BIP21 describes a way to encode payment request information such as address, amount, message etc as a URI. These URIs are a very popular way to share payment requests and you’ll often see them as links in a website or as QR codes. Today we’re releasing encodeBIP21 and decodeBIP21 to make it easy for your app to encode/decode BIP21 $BCH URIs.</p>

                <p>Bitcoin Cash is meant for people all over EARTH. Most of those people don’t speak english. That’s why today we’re releasing wordLists so you can generate mnemonics in 8 different languages to help spread $BCH to people all over the planet.</p>

                <h3 class="yellow">Extended Public Keys</h3>
                <p>Bitcoin Cash offers an unimaginably large number of addresses. This allows you to use a new address for every transaction which greatly increases your privacy. However most people keep their private keys offline in a hardware or paper wallet so it’s not conventient to generate new addresses for each transaction. Extended public keys (xpub) let you share or deploy only your xpub and applications can produce an infinite number of public keys and $BCH addresses, but can’t spend any of the $BCH sent to those addresses.</p>

                <p>HD Wallets are at the heart of most Bitcoin Cash apps. Being able to quickly create them can let developers create more exciting $BCH apps quicker than ever. Today we’re releasing 7 new utility methods to let you quickly generate mnemonics, root seeds, master private keys, HD wallets and then to sign and verify messages w/ keys from that wallet.</p>

                <p>Paper wallets let you print public and private keys as QR codes on to a piece of paper which can be stored offline. They are a very quick and convenient way to store coins safely (as long as the paper doesn’t degrade) and are much cheaper than a hardware wallet while maintaining much of the security</p>

                <p>Imagine you have a $BCH app which you’d like to deploy. However before doing that it seems like you should test it. BITBOX console lets you quickly switch between sending commands to your local instance or your full node running on the cloud. That way you can test your code locally before deploying to a remote server w/ production running $BCH node.</p>

                <p>When Bitcoin Cash began as a fork of $BTC on Aug 1st 2017 it kept the legacy address format. This ended up causing quite a bit of confusion and resulted in lost funds as users accidentially sent $BCH to $BTC addresses and vice versa.</p>

                <p>Bitcoin Cash wallets are really just collections of key pairs.
